## Description

ðŸ’¡ HTML, and CSS Portfolio with links to other projects.

I built this webpage in order to practice my skills and better understand the capabilities of both, HTML and CSS. Additionally, I wanted to have a portfolio to showcase what I've learned.

My hope, is to continue working on this portfolio and adding more content as I build more.

This webpage, serves to act as a central launch pad for all of my coding projects. It make's viewing my work both convenient and efficient.

This webpage utilizes advanced CSS styling and animations. It is highly responsive and interactive.
