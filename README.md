## Description

ðŸ’¡ HTML, and CSS Portfolio with links to other projects.

I built this webpage in order to practice my skills and better understand the capabilities of both, HTML and CSS. Additionally, I wanted to have a portfolio to showcase what I've learned.

My hope, is to continue working on this portfolio and adding more content as I build more.
